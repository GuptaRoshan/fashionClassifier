# Fashion Classifier

This project is a simple classifier for fashion items using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on Zalando's Fashion-MNIST dataset and can distinguish between types of fashion items like t-shirts, trousers, dresses, and shoes.

## Getting Started

To use this project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python dependencies. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script `train.py` to train the model.

## About the Model

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It's a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a combination of Convolutional, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.

In tests, this model reaches an accuracy of 90%.
